    <string name="movie_review_example">When I sat down to watch this film, I didn\'t know what to expect.
        I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece.
        The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is a music student in New York.
        He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons).</string>
